                <p> I am currently completing my second year at Victoria University of Wellington, majoring in
                    Interaction Design. Throughout high school I always enjoyed learning about digital technology and
                    exploring the different areas that it encompasses. Design Innovation has allowed me to explore my
                    interests and gain a more in depth look into web design and different programming languages.
                    I have always found it interesting to see how code can be applied to create online spaces and
                    features that can transform the look of something so quickly. Within Interaction Design, using code
                    to create better user experiences is something I find interesting and I hope to develop more skills
                    in this area to build upon what I know. </p>
