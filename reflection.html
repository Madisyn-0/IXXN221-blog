                    <p>For the first micro-assignment, I chose the home page of the KidsCan website to emulate. It was a fairly straightforward page and I only emulated the top half of the page. I found this MA to be very helpful in refreshing my prior knowledge of HTML and CSS and I found that I also had a chance to explore aligning multiple images which I had not done before. I struggled the most with aligning elements and in particular images. I was able to make a single image centre but I could not get the row of images to start in the centre. I also had trouble getting the text in the footer to format correctly.</p>

                    <p>I started making the main elements of my blog today, following the wireframes that I created on Figma. So far I have created the nav and linked the two pages together. I have added the main title to each page to make it easier to distinguish which page you are currently on. My next steps would be to continue to develop my wireframes to include a couple of different templates for different blog posts. This will allow me to have a more flexible design to work with when I have different sized pictures and different blocks of text.</p>

                    <p>When making the pitch to my group I found that it was important to try and explain my idea in a clear simple way to best express my concept in a way that everyone could understand. Scope was one of the main points that my group discussed when considering each other's pitches. While everyone had a good pitch, some ideas were not feasible for our skill level or time restraint. Collectively we chose the pitch that we thought best suited the restraints of the project and was an idea that we were all interested in. 
                        Once we had chosen our project idea, we had to consider the direction we wanted the project to go in order to narrow it down to a manageable concept. We soon realised that a website for small businesses could have a very large scope and audience base which would be unrealistic for us to try and tackle. Therefore, we narrowed it down to hospitality businesses that meet our criteria of local, sustainable/environmentally friendly, cost efficient, and charitable. </p>

It is quick and easy as it doesn’t require details like text and images but simply expresses the layout and flow of the page. As a group, we decided to allocate the pages between members and each make some iterations of our page. I had the 'about the businesses' page and was able to quickly model some different iterations using Figma. We will come together as a group and work through each blockframe to pick out elements that we like and create one, more finalised, blockframe for our website. </p>

                    <p>This week I worked on completing the part of the wireframes that I was working on. I used the style guide that my group put together to create a business page wireframe that followed the design systems that we came up with. My wireframes needed development from last week to ensure that they incorporated the new systems. For an example, the size and look of the buttons, approximate font sizes, image layout and the typography. Having these design systems in place allowed us to work on our pages individually and then come together to create a cohesive set of wireframes. As a group we also began to work on our prototype and start including colours and more specific details.

We wanted to test out our main navigation points and our filtering and search functions. These are key aspects of our website that we need to get right to create a website that user can actually interact with. We hope to receive feedback and insights that will aid us in improving our website and ensuring users enjoy the experience. We also wrote a few questions to ask the users during testing to gain more feedback on the design and experience of our prototype to ensure the content is clearly communicated and relevant. User testing will be a valuable step in our design process as it will allow us to see how a user interacts with our site and identify what parts of the interface confuse people and work to fix them. </p>
