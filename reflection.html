                    <p>I started making the main elements of my blog today, following the wireframes that I created on Figma. So far I have created the nav and linked the two pages together. I have added the main title to each page to make it easier to distinguish which page you are currently on. My next steps would be to continue to develop my wireframes to include a couple of different templates for different blog posts. This will allow me to have a more flexible design to work with when I have different sized pictures and different blocks of text.</p>
