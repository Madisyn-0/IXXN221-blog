                        <p>For the first micro-assignment, I chose the home page of the KidsCan website to emulate. It
                            was a fairly straightforward page and I only emulated the top half of the page. I found this
                            MA to be very helpful in refreshing my prior knowledge of HTML and CSS and I found that I
                            also had a chance to explore aligning multiple images which I had not done before. I
                            struggled the most with aligning elements and in particular images. I was able to make a
                            single image centre but I could not get the row of images to start in the centre. I also had
                            trouble getting the text in the footer to format correctly.</p>

                        <p>I started making the main elements of my blog today, following the wireframes that I created
                            on Figma. So far I have created the nav and linked the two pages together. I have added the
                            main title to each page to make it easier to distinguish which page you are currently on. My
                            next steps would be to continue to develop my wireframes to include a couple of different
                            templates for different blog posts. This will allow me to have a more flexible design to
                            work with when I have different sized pictures and different blocks of text.</p>

                            to get it to work after I realised I had not defined the flex container on the table class.
                            Flexbox is a very helpful tool that I will continue to use in future projects as it is able
                            to format elements in a lot of different ways.</p>

                            continue to develop and keep working on to get the different grid layouts to work. I think

                        <p>When making the pitch to my group I found that it was important to try and explain my idea in
                            a clear simple way to best express my concept in a way that everyone could understand. Scope
                            was one of the main points that my group discussed when considering each other's pitches.
                            While everyone had a good pitch, some ideas were not feasible for our skill level or time
                            restraint. Collectively we chose the pitch that we thought best suited the restraints of the
                            project and was an idea that we were all interested in.
                            Once we had chosen our project idea, we had to consider the direction we wanted the project
                            to go in order to narrow it down to a manageable concept. We soon realised that a website
                            for small businesses could have a very large scope and audience base which would be
                            unrealistic for us to try and tackle. Therefore, we narrowed it down to hospitality
                            businesses that meet our criteria of local, sustainable/environmentally friendly, cost
                            efficient, and charitable. </p>

                        <p>I learnt what the differences between a blockframe, wireframe and prototype are and how I can
                            use blockframes to communicate design ideas to users and/or clients. It is quick and easy as
                            it doesn’t require details like text and images but simply expresses the layout and flow of
                            the page. As a group, we decided to allocate the pages between members and each make some
                            iterations of our page. I had the 'about the businesses' page and was able to quickly model
                            some different iterations using Figma. We will come together as a group and work through
                            each blockframe to pick out elements that we like and create one, more finalised, blockframe
                            for our website. </p>

                            would be best for our design. Our wireframes will all take a similar layout of a main square

                            the consistency of this design and think it creates a minimal flow that will allow the user

                        <p>This week I worked on completing the part of the wireframes that I was working on. I used the
                            style guide that my group put together to create a business page wireframe that followed the
                            design systems that we came up with. My wireframes needed development from last week to
                            ensure that they incorporated the new systems. For an example, the size and look of the
                            buttons, approximate font sizes, image layout and the typography. Having these design
                            systems in place allowed us to work on our pages individually and then come together to
                            create a cohesive set of wireframes. As a group we also began to work on our prototype and
                            start including colours and more specific details.

                        <p>As a group we came up with some tasks for our users to complete when testing our prototype.
                            We wanted to test out our main navigation points and our filtering and search functions.
                            These are key aspects of our website that we need to get right to create a website that user
                            can actually interact with. We hope to receive feedback and insights that will aid us in
                            improving our website and ensuring users enjoy the experience. We also wrote a few questions
                            to ask the users during testing to gain more feedback on the design and experience of our
                            prototype to ensure the content is clearly communicated and relevant. User testing will be a
                            valuable step in our design process as it will allow us to see how a user interacts with our
                            site and identify what parts of the interface confuse people and work to fix them. </p>

                        <p>We presented our prototype to the class today and received a lot of helpful feedback that
                            will allow us to refine our prototype. Along with this feedback, we also gathered the
                            information we got from our user testing. This feedback and testing results enables us to
                            pinpoint the elements of our design that do not work or need to be improved to ensure we
                            enhance the user experience. Some of the main aspects that were identified are the layout of
                            the home page, text spacing, a lack of contrast on the buttons compared to other elements,
                            and our design of the nomination and editors pages as these could use some more refinement
                            to help finalise them. </p>

                        <p>Today my group worked on incorporating the feedback that we received from the presentations
                            into our prototype. We have expanded out our editors page to provide more information about
                            each editor and make it a more important page as it is a main part of our website. We also
                            changed our navigation layout as we found that the current buttons we were using did not
                            respond well to a smaller page size. We now have a horizontal nav at the top of the page
                            with buttons on either corner to navigate to the editors page and nominations page. The
                            feedback we have received has allowed us to continue to improve and enhance our prototypes
                            interactivity and overall design. </p>

                    <div class="text">
                        <p>Over the past few days we have implemented more of the feedback we received on Tuesday and
                            created the hover states for our buttons, refined our home page and icons and reworked the
                            colour scheme to ensure readability. Our original orange colour did not meet the contrast
                            ratio test as the white text on orange background was not very readable. To fix this we
                            decided to bring in a navy blue and use the orange as an accent colour. While this new
                            colour scheme differs from our original, it is important that the text is always readable.
                            With the final refinements of our prototype coming together, I created a GitHub repository
                            for our group to start working on coding our website. GitHub allows us to work
                            collaboratively and produce our website quicker as our group can work on the code separately
                            on branches and push it up to the same repository.</p>
